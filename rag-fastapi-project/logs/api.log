For SoCEA, SoEEC, and SoMCM, specific credit point totals are defined for each program, while SoANS uses different credit points.  A minor requires completing all courses specified by the minor program in addition to the primary major's requirements.  Minor credit requirements are 27 credit points for SoCEA, SoEEC, and SoMCM programs.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: tell me about graduation failer, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Graduation failure occurs when an undergraduate student completes their coursework but doesn't meet all graduation requirements. This can be due to failing grades ('F' or 'D') in one or more courses, or an insufficient Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) or Major Grade Point Average (MGPA).

If the failure is due to 'F' or 'D' grades, the student may be allowed by their School Managing Council (SMC) to repeat the failed course(s), provided the course(s) haven't been discontinued.  The provided text does not detail procedures for CGPA or MGPA deficiencies.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: if i get f i dont graduate, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Yes, if you receive an 'F' grade in a required course and that prevents you from meeting the minimum requirements for graduation, you will not graduate.  However, you may be allowed to repeat the failed course(s) with the permission of your School Managing Council (SMC), provided the course hasn't been discontinued.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: i got cgpa of 3 but also have f in one of my course, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Based on the provided text, a CGPA of 3.0 might or might not be sufficient for graduation, depending on the minimum CGPA requirement of your program.  The 'F' grade in one course is a definite problem, as it prevents graduation unless you can repeat and pass the course.  Your School Managing Council (SMC) will determine whether you can repeat the failed course.  If the course is still offered, they may allow you to re-register and retake it.  If you successfully pass the course with a passing grade, then your CGPA will be recalculated.  Whether your final CGPA will then be sufficient for graduation depends on the minimum CGPA requirement.  You need to contact your SMC to understand your specific situation and options.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: i got cgpa of 3 but also have f in one of my course, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: A CGPA of 3.0 might be sufficient for graduation, but the 'F' grade in one course prevents graduation unless you can repeat and pass the course.  Your School Managing Council (SMC) will determine if you can retake the failed course.  If allowed, and you pass, your CGPA will be recalculated.  Whether the final CGPA is sufficient for graduation depends on your program's minimum CGPA requirement. Contact your SMC to understand your options.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: sorry for me, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: There's nothing to apologize for.  I understand you're facing a challenging situation with your grades and graduation.  Based on our conversation, you have a CGPA of 3.0 but also an 'F' grade in a course, preventing you from graduating.

Your next steps should be to:

1. **Contact your School Managing Council (SMC) immediately.** They are the authority on whether you can repeat the failed course and what the minimum CGPA requirement is for your program.  They will assess your situation and advise you on the best course of action.

2. **Determine if the course is still being offered.** If it is, the SMC can likely approve you to re-register and retake it.  If it's not, you'll need to discuss alternative options with the SMC.

3. **Understand the minimum CGPA requirement.** Once you know if you can retake the course, and what grade you need to achieve, you can determine if your recalculated CGPA will meet the minimum requirement for graduation.


Don't hesitate to contact your academic advisor as well for support and guidance. They can help you navigate this process.

A course might be crucial for your major or overall GPA, leading to graduation failure if you don't pass, but it might not be a formal prerequisite for a specific *subsequent* course.  The provided text demonstrates this; failing Applied Math I prevents graduation, but it's not explicitly stated as a prerequisite for Applied Math II, though it's strongly implied.  The key difference lies in whether the course is a formal requirement to *enroll* in another course (prerequisite) versus a requirement to *graduate* (which can encompass many courses, not just prerequisites).

INFO:root:Session ID: string, Response: Whether you can graduate with a 'D' grade depends on several factors not fully detailed in the provided text.  A 'D' grade in a *required* course might prevent graduation if it brings your CGPA or MGPA below the minimum required for your program.  However, if the 'D' is in a non-essential course and your overall GPA meets the minimum requirements, you might still graduate.  

The crucial element is your program's specific rules and the overall impact of the 'D' grade on your CGPA and MGPA.  To know for sure, you MUST check your program's requirements, consult your academic advisor, or contact your School Managing Council (SMC). They have the definitive answer based on your specific circumstances.
