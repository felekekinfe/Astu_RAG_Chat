INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: course waiver, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Course waivers allow students to bypass one or more courses under exceptional circumstances.  The request can originate from the student or their advisor, but requires approval from both the School Managing Council (SMC) and the University Senate.  However, waivers are generally not permitted for major/core courses or prerequisites.  Only students who have completed all other graduation requirements are typically eligible.  A maximum of two courses can be waived per student.  Course waivers may be considered as a last resort for students experiencing "course allergic" situations (failing a course three times), if an equivalent course cannot be substituted.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: course waiver, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Course waivers are granted under exceptional circumstances, allowing students to bypass one or more courses.  The process requires a request (from the student or advisor), approval by the School Managing Council (SMC), and final endorsement from the University Senate.  However, waivers are generally not allowed for major/core courses or prerequisites.  Eligibility is typically limited to students who've completed all other graduation requirements, with a maximum of two waivers per student.  Waivers might be considered for students who have failed a course three times ("course allergic") if a suitable alternative course isn't available.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: dual degree, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: The provided text refers to a "double major," not a "dual degree."  A double major allows a student to complete the requirements for two different majors within a single bachelor's degree program.  The text states that students in good academic standing may pursue a double major, combining majors from two different programs, to prepare them for complex real-world problems requiring interdisciplinary knowledge.  There is no information about dual degrees (which typically involve two separate degrees, such as a BA and an MA).

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: so what is its requirement, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: The requirements for a double major are to successfully complete all courses for both majors.  Credit requirements vary.  For SoCEA, SoEEC, and SoMCM, specific credit point totals are defined for each program, while SoANS uses different credit points.  A minor requires completing all courses specified by the minor program in addition to the primary major's requirements.  Minor credit requirements are 27 credit points for SoCEA, SoEEC, and SoMCM programs.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: tell me about graduation failer, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Graduation failure occurs when an undergraduate student completes their coursework but doesn't meet all graduation requirements. This can be due to failing grades ('F' or 'D') in one or more courses, or an insufficient Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) or Major Grade Point Average (MGPA).

If the failure is due to 'F' or 'D' grades, the student may be allowed by their School Managing Council (SMC) to repeat the failed course(s), provided the course(s) haven't been discontinued.  The provided text does not detail procedures for CGPA or MGPA deficiencies.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: if i get f i dont graduate, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Yes, if you receive an 'F' grade in a required course and that prevents you from meeting the minimum requirements for graduation, you will not graduate.  However, you may be allowed to repeat the failed course(s) with the permission of your School Managing Council (SMC), provided the course hasn't been discontinued.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: i got cgpa of 3 but also have f in one of my course, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Based on the provided text, a CGPA of 3.0 might or might not be sufficient for graduation, depending on the minimum CGPA requirement of your program.  The 'F' grade in one course is a definite problem, as it prevents graduation unless you can repeat and pass the course.  Your School Managing Council (SMC) will determine whether you can repeat the failed course.  If the course is still offered, they may allow you to re-register and retake it.  If you successfully pass the course with a passing grade, then your CGPA will be recalculated.  Whether your final CGPA will then be sufficient for graduation depends on the minimum CGPA requirement.  You need to contact your SMC to understand your specific situation and options.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: i got cgpa of 3 but also have f in one of my course, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: A CGPA of 3.0 might be sufficient for graduation, but the 'F' grade in one course prevents graduation unless you can repeat and pass the course.  Your School Managing Council (SMC) will determine if you can retake the failed course.  If allowed, and you pass, your CGPA will be recalculated.  Whether the final CGPA is sufficient for graduation depends on your program's minimum CGPA requirement. Contact your SMC to understand your options.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: sorry for me, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: There's nothing to apologize for.  I understand you're facing a challenging situation with your grades and graduation.  Based on our conversation, you have a CGPA of 3.0 but also an 'F' grade in a course, preventing you from graduating.

Your next steps should be to:

1. **Contact your School Managing Council (SMC) immediately.** They are the authority on whether you can repeat the failed course and what the minimum CGPA requirement is for your program.  They will assess your situation and advise you on the best course of action.

2. **Determine if the course is still being offered.** If it is, the SMC can likely approve you to re-register and retake it.  If it's not, you'll need to discuss alternative options with the SMC.

3. **Understand the minimum CGPA requirement.** Once you know if you can retake the course, and what grade you need to achieve, you can determine if your recalculated CGPA will meet the minimum requirement for graduation.


Don't hesitate to contact your academic advisor as well for support and guidance. They can help you navigate this process.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, Response: Exciting news about joining Adama Science and Technology University (ASTU) this year!  ASTU, located in Adama, Oromia, Ethiopia, is a public university focusing on science, engineering, and technology.  Founded in 1993, it's grown significantly since its beginnings as Nazareth Technical College.

Here's what you should know:

* **Academic Focus:** ASTU excels in STEM fields. You'll find programs in engineering (including Computer Science and Engineering), applied natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.  They offer undergraduate (BSc, B.Tech) and postgraduate (MSc, M.Tech, PhD) degrees.  Double majors are possible, allowing you to combine majors from different programs.

* **Resources:** The university boasts at least two libraries – a central and engineering library, plus another likely focused on applied sciences, social sciences, and humanities.  These provide access to books, journals, e-resources, study spaces, computers, and research assistance.  There's also an on-campus health clinic for your well-being.  Research opportunities are available through the various research and innovation centers.

* **Student Life:**  The ASTU Anfi (Amphitheater) is a great place to relax, socialize, and study with friends.  The university has support systems in place for course waivers (under specific circumstances), handling failed courses, and navigating other academic challenges.  The School Managing Council (SMC) plays a key role in student academic matters.

* **Key Things to Remember:**  You'll need to meet specific credit requirements for your chosen program and any minors.  There are also minimum CGPA requirements for graduation.  Failing a course, especially a core or prerequisite course, could affect your ability to graduate on time.


I hope this overview is helpful!  Do you have any specific questions about programs, admission, student life, or other aspects of ASTU that you'd like me to address?  I'm happy to help you prepare for your exciting new chapter!
