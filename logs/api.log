For SoCEA, SoEEC, and SoMCM, specific credit point totals are defined for each program, while SoANS uses different credit points.  A minor requires completing all courses specified by the minor program in addition to the primary major's requirements.  Minor credit requirements are 27 credit points for SoCEA, SoEEC, and SoMCM programs.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: tell me about graduation failer, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Graduation failure occurs when an undergraduate student completes their coursework but doesn't meet all graduation requirements. This can be due to failing grades ('F' or 'D') in one or more courses, or an insufficient Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) or Major Grade Point Average (MGPA).

If the failure is due to 'F' or 'D' grades, the student may be allowed by their School Managing Council (SMC) to repeat the failed course(s), provided the course(s) haven't been discontinued.  The provided text does not detail procedures for CGPA or MGPA deficiencies.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: if i get f i dont graduate, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Yes, if you receive an 'F' grade in a required course and that prevents you from meeting the minimum requirements for graduation, you will not graduate.  However, you may be allowed to repeat the failed course(s) with the permission of your School Managing Council (SMC), provided the course hasn't been discontinued.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: i got cgpa of 3 but also have f in one of my course, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: Based on the provided text, a CGPA of 3.0 might or might not be sufficient for graduation, depending on the minimum CGPA requirement of your program.  The 'F' grade in one course is a definite problem, as it prevents graduation unless you can repeat and pass the course.  Your School Managing Council (SMC) will determine whether you can repeat the failed course.  If the course is still offered, they may allow you to re-register and retake it.  If you successfully pass the course with a passing grade, then your CGPA will be recalculated.  Whether your final CGPA will then be sufficient for graduation depends on the minimum CGPA requirement.  You need to contact your SMC to understand your specific situation and options.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: i got cgpa of 3 but also have f in one of my course, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: A CGPA of 3.0 might be sufficient for graduation, but the 'F' grade in one course prevents graduation unless you can repeat and pass the course.  Your School Managing Council (SMC) will determine if you can retake the failed course.  If allowed, and you pass, your CGPA will be recalculated.  Whether the final CGPA is sufficient for graduation depends on your program's minimum CGPA requirement. Contact your SMC to understand your options.

INFO:root:Session ID: string, User Query: sorry for me, Model: gemini-1.5-flash
INFO:root:Session ID: string, AI Response: There's nothing to apologize for.  I understand you're facing a challenging situation with your grades and graduation.  Based on our conversation, you have a CGPA of 3.0 but also an 'F' grade in a course, preventing you from graduating.

Your next steps should be to:

1. **Contact your School Managing Council (SMC) immediately.** They are the authority on whether you can repeat the failed course and what the minimum CGPA requirement is for your program.  They will assess your situation and advise you on the best course of action.

2. **Determine if the course is still being offered.** If it is, the SMC can likely approve you to re-register and retake it.  If it's not, you'll need to discuss alternative options with the SMC.

3. **Understand the minimum CGPA requirement.** Once you know if you can retake the course, and what grade you need to achieve, you can determine if your recalculated CGPA will meet the minimum requirement for graduation.


Don't hesitate to contact your academic advisor as well for support and guidance. They can help you navigate this process.

A course might be crucial for your major or overall GPA, leading to graduation failure if you don't pass, but it might not be a formal prerequisite for a specific *subsequent* course.  The provided text demonstrates this; failing Applied Math I prevents graduation, but it's not explicitly stated as a prerequisite for Applied Math II, though it's strongly implied.  The key difference lies in whether the course is a formal requirement to *enroll* in another course (prerequisite) versus a requirement to *graduate* (which can encompass many courses, not just prerequisites).

Falling below these thresholds can lead to warnings, probation, or even dismissal, depending on the severity and duration of poor performance.  Specifically, an SGPA below 1.50 or a CGPA below 1.75 (for second-year students) or 1.85 (for third-year and above students) risks dismissal.  Two consecutive poor semesters will trigger dismissal.  Poor standing also blocks opportunities like course overloads, double majors/minors, and ultimately, graduation.  To maintain good standing, you MUST consistently achieve the required GPAs.  If you receive warnings, seek academic advising immediately to create a plan for improvement.

INFO:root:Session ID: 922e5b0a-5a4c-46b9-83df-6802b3edc2c8, Response: That's a bit vague!  To give you a precise answer, I need more context.  "How much time it takes" for what?  Are you asking about:

* **Withdrawing from a course?** You have six weeks from registration to withdraw, but you'll need advisor approval and valid documentation.  Failure to meet these deadlines can seriously impact your academic standing.

* **Registering for a make-up exam?**  For regular students, it's at least one month before the final exam. Graduating students have a shorter window, typically three weeks after the next semester begins.

* **Adding or dropping a course after the registration period?** You have three weeks from the end of the normal registration period, but this requires specific circumstances and approvals.

Please clarify your question so I can give you the precise timeframe you need.  Think of it like finding the perfect blend for your buna—the more detail you provide, the better the result!

INFO:root:Session ID: 922e5b0a-5a4c-46b9-83df-6802b3edc2c8, Response: The question "how much time it takes" is too vague.  To answer accurately, I need specifics.  Are you asking about the time needed for:

* **Completing a specific course?**  This depends on the course (e.g., CSEg5305 requires completion of CSEg3202).  Provide the course code for a precise estimate based on its credit hours and workload.

* **Finishing the entire CSE program?** The CSE program at ASTU is a five-year program.

* **Meeting deadlines for course registration, withdrawal, or make-up exams?**  Deadlines vary.  For withdrawals, you have six weeks from registration, but require advisor approval and valid documentation. Make-up exams have different deadlines for regular and graduating students. Adding or dropping courses after the registration period has a three-week window, subject to specific conditions.

Please clarify your question with more details. The more information you provide, the more accurate and helpful my response will be. Think of it like brewing the perfect cup of buna – the more precise your instructions, the better the final product!

INFO:root:Session ID: ecf5d56a-a01c-448a-ab5f-add30e99b68a, Response: A "graduate failure" at ASTU is a student who has completed their coursework but did not meet the requirements for graduation. This can be due to failing grades ('F' or 'D') or an insufficient Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) or Major Grade Point Average (MGPA).  If a student exhausts all options to improve their grades (e.g., repeating courses) and still doesn't meet the minimum requirements, they receive a certificate of attendance instead of a degree, and their transcript will note them as a "graduate failure".
