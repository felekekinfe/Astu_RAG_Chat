A student receives approval from their concerned Department Head or academic advisor to adjust their course load.
A student is exempted from certain courses after successfully passing a special examination for those courses.
All such additions or dropping of courses must be completed within three weeks from the end of the normal registration period.

Semester Load Adjustments:
Students wishing to take a course load that is less than the required minimum or more than the maximum allowable semester load must obtain special permission. This request should be made through their academic advisor to the Department Academic Committee (DAC) of their affiliation and subsequently to the School Managing Council (SMC) of the concerned School.

Dropping Out or Withdrawing from the University:
The university generally discourages students from dropping out or withdrawing unless the student faces a very serious problem. Students who withdraw for reasons deemed inadequate by the university may be denied readmission.
Students intending to drop out or withdraw for a semester or an entire academic year are required to discuss the matter thoroughly with their academic advisor first.
Applications to withdraw must be submitted within six weeks after the semester's registration date to the respective department head or School dean. If a student wishes to withdraw after this six-week period, the application must be approved by the concerned School Managing Council (SMC).
All reasons for withdrawal must be supported by reliable and irrefutable documentation. The application, along with the necessary documents, is then forwarded to the School Managing Council for a final decision.
If permission to withdraw is granted, the office of the school registrar and/or the student admission and registration office must be notified immediately. The student must then begin the university clearance process as soon as possible.

University Clearance Procedures:
Proper clearance procedures are mandatory for all students upon completion of each academic year and upon graduation. Failure to strictly follow these procedures may result in the student being denied access to all university services at a later date.
To initiate clearance, every student must collect three copies of the official clearance form from the registrar’s office of their respective School.
After completing the forms and having them signed by all appropriate university offices (e.g., library, finance, department, dormitory), the student must submit one copy to the School Registrar, one copy to their department, and keep the third copy for their own personal records.
Important Note: No academic transcripts, degrees, diplomas, letters of recommendation, or any other university services will be issued to students who cannot produce an appropriately completed and signed clearance form.

Topic: Academic Options: Fast Track, Double Major, and Minor Fields of Study

The university provides opportunities for students with diverse academic interests to enhance their programs by pursuing a fast track, a double major, or a minor field of study. A double major, in particular, is seen as a way to prepare students for complex real-world problems that require interdisciplinary knowledge. Students who are in good academic standing may be permitted to undertake a double major or a minor, combining majors from two different programs.

General Provisions for Double Major and Minor:
Bachelor's degree programs may offer these options, designed to enable students to achieve a satisfactory level of specialization in both chosen disciplines.

Requirements for Double Major:
A student pursuing a double major must successfully complete all courses specified by the second major program, in addition to fulfilling all course requirements for their primary major program.
Credit requirements for a double major vary by school: specific credit points are defined for programs in the School of Civil Engineering and Architecture (SoCEA), School of Electrical Engineering and Computing (SoEEC), and School of Mechanical, Chemical and Materials Engineering (SoMCM), and different credit points for programs in the School of Applied Natural Sciences (SoANS).

Requirements for Minor:
A student pursuing a minor must successfully complete all courses specified by the secondary program for that minor, while also completing all required courses for their primary major program.
Credit requirements for a minor are 27 credit points for programs within SoCEA, SoEEC, and SoMCM.

Application and Eligibility:
The deadline for declaring a double major is the registration date of the student's first semester of their fourth year for engineering programs, and the first semester of their third year for science programs.
To be eligible to apply for a double major or minor, a student must have a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 3.50 or higher in their primary major and must have completed a minimum of three semesters in that primary major program.

Semester Load and Duration:
A student approved for a double major or minor may be allowed to exceed the normal maximum credit points per semester set by the University. However, they must petition in advance to determine if this overload will be approved.
The total duration of study for students with a double major or minor may not exceed 12 semesters for programs in SoCEA, SoEEC, and SoMCM, and 10 semesters for programs in SoANS.

Application Process and Guidelines:
The application process for double major and minor programs will follow specific guidelines issued for these options.
Detailed regulations for fast track, double major, and minor fields of study will be governed by a comprehensive guideline to be issued by the University Senate.

Topic: Regulations for Repeating Courses

This section outlines the rules and conditions under which students may repeat courses they have previously taken.

Repeating Courses with Grades Other Than 'F':
Repeating a course for which a student has not received an 'F' grade is not an automatic right. It is generally granted only if a specific minimum grade is required for that course and the student has not achieved it.

Repeating Courses with 'D' Grade (Borderline Final Year Students):
Only students who are considered borderline (academically) in their final year of study may be permitted, at the discretion of their program, to repeat courses in which they received a 'D' grade. Such a course may not be repeated more than once, unless specific minimum requirements (as per sub-Article 81.1, not detailed here but referenced) apply.

Consequences of Failing a Repeated 'D' Grade Course:
If a student obtains an 'F' grade after repeating a course for which they previously had a 'D', they are considered to have failed that course twice. This situation subjects them to further provisions outlined in sub-Articles 91.4 through 91.6.

Repeating Courses with 'F' Grade:
A student who has received an 'F' grade in a course is allowed to repeat that course up to two times.

Attendance and Participation in Repeated Courses:
Students permitted to repeat a course due to unsatisfactory performance must register for the course and attend all related activities (lectures, labs, etc.) just like regular students. The School Managing Council, in consultation with the course instructor, may agree to waive certain requirements in specific cases.

Recording of Grades for Repeated Courses:
When a course is repeated, any previous grade(s) of 'F' or 'D' for that course will be recorded on the transcript but will be marked (e.g., crossed-over) and will not be included in any subsequent Grade Point Average (GPA) computation.
If a student achieves a grade of 'B+' or higher on a repeated course, it will be recorded as a 'B' on their transcript. Any grade of 'C' or below 'C' earned on a repeated course will be recorded as is.



Topic: Addressing 'Course Allergic' Situations (Repeated Failure in a Course)

A "course allergic" situation arises when a student, after taking a specific course three times (once as a normal registration and twice by repeating it), is still unable to achieve a passing grade.
In such cases, the student will be required to take an equivalent course or courses as determined by the School Managing Council (SMC) of the School in which they are enrolled.
If finding a suitable equivalent course is not possible, the provisions outlined in Article 93 (Course Waiver) of the legislation may be applied to handle the student's case.

Topic: Provisions for Course Waivers

Under certain unique circumstances, the School Managing Council (SMC) of a student's respective School may permit the waiver of one or more courses for that particular student. This can be initiated at the request of the student or their academic advisor. However, any decision by the SMC to grant a course waiver must subsequently be endorsed by the University Senate.

Restrictions on Course Waivers:
Course waivers are generally not allowed for:
Major area courses (core courses specific to the student's field of study).
Any course that serves as a prerequisite for other courses in the curriculum.

Eligibility for Requesting Waiver:
A request for a course waiver will typically only be considered for students who have already completed all other graduation requirements.

Limit on Waivers:
The maximum number of courses that can be waived for any single student shall not exceed two courses.

Consequences of Failing a Course Three Times without Waiver:
If a student scores an 'F' grade in any course for the third time, and if no substitute course exists and a course waiver is not granted, the student shall be dismissed from the university for good.



Topic: Managing Phased-Out and Substituted Courses

This section clarifies how the university handles courses that are discontinued (phased-out) or replaced by new ones (substituted).

Definitions:
Phased-out courses are courses that are no longer offered by the University.
Substituted courses are courses that are similar to phased-out courses but may have some modifications in content or structure.

Impact on Readmitted Students:
Students who have previously taken and passed phased-out courses within the University system are not required to take the new replacement courses if they are readmitted.

Handling 'F' Grades in Phased-Out Courses:
Students who have scored 'F' grades in phased-out courses will be required to clear these failing grades by taking equivalent courses. The specific equivalent courses will be determined by the School Managing Council (SMC) of the School in which the student is enrolled.

Grade Substitution Scenarios:
When one new course replaces two or more older courses that had varying credit values:
If a student had an 'F' grade in each of the older, phased-out courses, the grade earned in the new substitute course will replace the 'F' grade for both of the previous courses.
If a student had an 'F' grade in only one of the two older, phased-out courses, both the original 'F' and the grade from the other older course will appear on their transcript. However, only the grade earned for the new substitute course will be used in the computation of their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).

Topic: Semester Credit Load for Regular Undergraduate Students

This article specifies the normal, minimum, and maximum credit hours regular undergraduate students are expected to take per semester, and conditions for deviations.

Standard Semester Load:
Unless otherwise specified in this Legislation or other Senate rules, the minimum number of credit hours for full-time regular students is 15 per semester.
The maximum normal load shall not exceed 19 credit hours per semester.

Permission for Overload (Exceeding Maximum Load):
A student may request special permission to take more than 19 credit hours, up to a maximum of 22 credit hours. This requires approval from the School Managing Council (SMC) and the Department Academic Committee (DAC) if the student meets certain conditions:
The student is in their year of graduation.
The student has successfully completed coursework equivalent to one academic year and has a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 2.75 or higher.

Semester Load for Special Programs:
The maximum semester load for students in fast track programs, or those pursuing a double major or minor, shall be 26 credit hours.
This 26 credit hour maximum does not apply to first-year fast track students who have passed special examinations to accelerate their studies.

Semester Load for Specific Student Categories:
Students who are graduation failures (needing to repeat courses to graduate) and readmitted students may be permitted to take a semester load that is below the standard minimum of 15 credit hours.

---

Topic: Duration of Study, Maximum Program Stay, and Course Validity in Undergraduate Programs

This section defines the expected timeframes for completing undergraduate degrees, the maximum allowable time a student can be enrolled in a program, and how long course credits remain valid.

Standard Duration of Study:
For regular undergraduate degree programs, the normal duration of study is from four to five years.
For students pursuing a double major or minor, there may be an extension of one additional year to the normal duration.
For undergraduate degrees in continuing education programs (e.g., evening, weekend), the duration of study is typically five to eight years, depending on the specific program structure.

Maximum Length of Stay in a Program:
The maximum time students are allowed to remain in their study program, calculated from their initial date of enrolment, shall not exceed twice the normal duration of study for their respective programs. (For example, a 4-year program has a maximum stay of 8 years).

Residency Schemes for 'Kiremt' In-service Programs:
Schools are expected to develop residency schemes that may bring students enrolled in ‘Kiremt’ (summer) in-service programs into regular program schedules for periods up to one year. The aim of this is to help shorten the overall length of stay for students in these in-service programs.

Validity of Courses:
The maximum length of stay permitted in a program also dictates the maximum length of time for which courses taken within that program remain valid.
For instance, if a course is taken as part of a four-year degree program, that course credit will be valid for eight years from the end of the semester in which it was taken.

Consequences of Exceeding Maximum Stay:
A student who fails to complete their studies before the expiry of the maximum permitted length of time will be dismissed from that program.
However, if the program uses a modular course offering system, the student will be certified for any modules they have successfully completed.

Options After Dismissal Due to Exceeding Maximum Stay:
A student dismissed under this provision may apply for admission into a different program. If granted admission to a new program, they may request exemption from courses taken in the previous program, provided the validity of those courses has not expired.

Topic: Credit Hour Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees

This article outlines the total credit points or credit hours required for the completion of undergraduate bachelor programs.

Minimum and Maximum Total Credit Points for Five-Year Programs:
For a five-year bachelor's program, the minimum total credit points required for graduation shall be 150 credit hours.
The maximum total credit points for such programs shall be 180 credit hours.

Credit Points for Dual Major and Minor:
The calculation of minimum and maximum credit points for students pursuing a dual major or a minor will be governed by specific guidelines set forth by the University.

Proportion of Time for Courses/Modules:
The allocation of time for various components of a course or module (such as lectures, laboratory work, tutorials, home study, etc.) shall be determined by the academic unit (department or school) offering that course or module. This allocation must then follow the approval process involving the Department Academic Committee (DAC) and the School Managing Council (SMC).

---

Topic: Class Attendance Requirements

This section specifies the university's rules regarding student attendance in academic activities.

General Attendance Requirement:
Unless specifically provided otherwise in this Legislation or in a separate rule issued by the University Senate, a student is required to attend all scheduled lecture, laboratory, and practical sessions, as well as any field work components of their courses.

Minimum Attendance for Earning Credit:
If a student fails to attend all sessions due to reasons beyond their control, a minimum of 80% attendance is generally required for them to be eligible to earn credit in a given course.

Exceptions to the 80% Rule:
The 80% minimum attendance rule does not prevent:
Schools from demanding 100% attendance for specific courses or activities where full attendance is deemed academically indispensable.
Schools or departments from excluding certain portions of a course, such as critical laboratory experiences or field work judged essential for the student, from the 20% allowable non-attendance. These components may require 100% attendance.

Consequences of Insufficient Attendance (Below 80%):
A student who has missed more than 20% of the scheduled sessions for a course will be given a grade of 'IA' (Incomplete Attendance).
This student will then be required to provide acceptable and valid reasons for their failure to attend classes.

Resolution of 'IA' Grade:
If the student's incomplete attendance is proven to have been for valid reasons (e.g., documented illness, serious personal emergency), their registration for that course will be cancelled. They will then be permitted to take the course afresh (re-register and attend) in a future semester.
If the student’s incomplete attendance was due to reasons that are not considered valid by the university, the 'IA' grade will be automatically changed to an 'F' (Fail) grade at the end of the third week of their next enrolment period in the department.

---

Topic: Earning Course Credits Through Special Examination (Credit by Examination)

The university allows students to earn academic credit for certain courses by passing an examination without formally attending the course sessions, under specific conditions.

Eligibility and Evidence:
If a student can present sufficient and convincing evidence to the chairperson of the program in which they are enrolled, demonstrating that they have already acquired the knowledge, insight, or skills taught in a particular course listed in the University catalogue (without having attended that course at ASTU), they may be permitted to register for that course during a regular registration period to obtain credit and a grade solely through examination.

Minimum Grade Requirement for Credit by Examination:
To earn credit through such a special examination, a student must achieve a minimum grade of A-, A, or A+. The grade achieved will be included in their grade calculation and will appear on their academic transcript.

Courses Not Eligible for Credit by Examination:
If a School offers certain courses for which it does not permit the earning of credit through examination alone, it must submit a list of these specific courses to the Student Admission and Registration Office.

Minimum Regular Attendance Requirement:
Of the total number of credit hours required by a program or School for graduation, a student must earn a minimum of 75% of those credits through regular attendance in courses.
In exceptional cases, the School Managing Council (SMC) of the School, with the approval of the Senate's Academic Standard and Quality Assurance committee, may permit a student to take a lesser percentage of the required hours through regular attendance (implying more could be earned by examination or other means).

Approval Process:
Registration to earn credits on the basis of examinations must be formally approved by the School Managing Council (SMC) of the relevant School.

---

Topic: Procedures for Examination Administration

This article outlines the rules and responsibilities governing the conduct and administration of examinations at the university.

Candidate List:
A list of all students eligible to sit for an examination must be prepared in advance by the department to which the students belong. This list must be provided to the invigilators for the purpose of checking attendance during the examination.

Exam Paper Submission and Collection by Course Coordinator:
The course coordinator is responsible for submitting the examination paper to the chair office of the department administering the course one day before the scheduled exam time.
The course coordinator must also collect the completed exam papers from the same office 15 to 20 minutes after the official end time of the examination.

Assignment of Invigilators:
The School registrar's office is responsible for assigning invigilators for examinations conducted within the School.
For courses that are offered across multiple Schools, invigilators will be assigned by the School registrar's office, drawing from course instructors within the School where the students are enrolled.
The primary course instructor is expected to supervise their own examination.

Invigilator Responsibilities (Timing):
An invigilator must collect the exam papers from the department administering the course(s) 30 minutes before the scheduled start time of the exam.
An invigilator must arrive at the designated exam hall or room 15 minutes before the exam is due to begin.
An invigilator must submit the completed exam papers back to the department administering the course(s) no later than 15 minutes after the end of the exam, ensuring the course coordinator is present during this handover.

Student Admittance and Departure from Exam Hall:
No student will be admitted into an examination hall if they arrive 30 minutes or more after the examination has officially begun.
No student will be allowed to leave an examination hall within the first 30 minutes of the examination's start time, and not before they have signed the examination attendance sheet.

Leaving Exam Hall for Health Reasons:
If a student is forced to leave an examination hall due to health reasons, and provided the student is conscious and in a sound state of mind, the invigilator present must inform the student that a medical doctor's certification must be obtained promptly to substantiate the claim of sickness or illness.

Invigilator's Report:
Upon the completion of an examination, the invigilator is required to submit a report on the conduct of the examination. This is done by completing a form specifically prepared for this purpose. The report must be submitted to the department that offers the course.

Topic: Regulations for Make-up Examinations

Make-up examinations provide an opportunity for students who miss a final examination due to uncontrollable circumstances to take the exam at a later date.

Purpose Limitation:
Make-up examinations are not permitted for the purpose of simply trying to raise existing grade point averages. They are specifically for students who were genuinely unable to sit for a final examination and consequently received an 'I' (Incomplete) grade.
Generally, a student will not be allowed to take make-up examinations more than two times throughout their entire period of study.

Application Procedure for Make-up Exam:
A student who missed a final exam, or a person legitimately representing the student, must submit a written application with valid and documented reasons (e.g., hospitalization, serious accident) for their absence. This application must be submitted to the relevant department head within one week after the start of the subsequent semester.

Consequences of Invalid Reasons:
If the School Managing Council (SMC) determines that the student did not have valid reasons for missing the final examination, the 'I' grade on the student's record will automatically be changed to an 'F' (Fail). The student's Grade Point Averages (GPAs) will then be calculated accordingly, and their academic status determined.

Scheduling and Content of Make-up Exam:
A student permitted to sit for a make-up examination will normally register for and take the examination when the final examination for that course is next administered to other students.
The department offering the course must immediately inform the concerned instructor in writing about the SMC's decision. This allows the instructor to prepare a different set of examination questions if they feel there has been a significant change in course content, delivery mode, or course activities since the semester the student originally attended the course.
If the course is not administered in the immediately following semester, or if the course is a prerequisite for another course to be offered in the subsequent semester, the concerned SMC may allow an "automatic" make-up examination to be scheduled sooner.

Registration for Make-up Exam:
A student allowed to take a make-up examination must apply and register for it at least one month before the final examination for that course is scheduled. The specific dates for this registration will be announced by the Student Admission and Registration office.

Make-up Exams for Graduating Students:
A graduating student in their final semester who fails to sit for final examinations in one or more courses for valid reasons will be allowed to sit for a make-up examination within three weeks of the beginning of the following regular semester.
If such a student is in the first semester of their final year, they will be allowed to sit for make-up examinations in a maximum of two courses within three weeks of the following semester.

Academic Standing and Make-up Exams:
If a student has fewer than three (i.e., one or two) 'I' grades in a semester and is allowed to take a make-up examination:
They may continue their studies in the subsequent semester if they are otherwise in good academic standing (Semester GPA (SGPA) ≥ 1.75 and Cumulative GPA (CGPA) ≥ 2.00). For such students, the SGPA is calculated based on graded courses, excluding those with 'I's. They must still apply for and sit for the make-up exams as per standard procedure.
If they are not in good academic standing, they must withdraw from studies for the subsequent semester, and the standard make-up exam procedure applies. The grade earned from the make-up exam will be used to compute the GPAs for the semester in which the make-up exam is given.

Students with Three or More 'I' Grades:
A student who has three or more 'I' grades in a single semester and is due to sit for make-up examinations must, irrespective of their academic status, withdraw from the University for academic reasons. They then apply for the make-up exams as per standard procedure. No GPAs will be calculated, and no academic status will be determined for such a student until the results of their make-up examinations are known.

Expiry of 'I' Grade:
Any 'I' grade that is not removed (i.e., replaced with a letter grade through a make-up exam or other resolution) within one year, as per the provisions of this article, will automatically be converted to an 'F' grade.

---

Topic: Provisions for Supplementary Examinations (Re-exams)

Supplementary examinations, or re-exams, offer another chance for students under specific circumstances, particularly those who have failed courses and have limited options to repeat them.

Eligibility for Re-examination:
Re-examinations shall be allowed for:
A student in any year of study who scored an 'F' grade and may not have the possibility of repeating the course(s), for example, due to the discontinuity of an academic program or if no substitute course is available.
A readmitted student who faces the same situations (discontinued program, no substitute course) for courses in which they received either 'D' or 'F' grades.
A student who is a "graduate failure" (failed to meet graduation requirements) due to 'D' or 'F' grades, if there is no possibility of repeating the course(s).

Conditions for Granting Re-examination:
The courses eligible for re-examination must be those that the student had taken during the preceding semesters of their program.
The maximum number of courses for which re-examination can be taken is two for a graduating student, and a maximum of four for students described under the general eligibility (e.g., due to program discontinuity).
The student’s Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) must be such that if they achieve a minimum 'C' grade on the re-examination(s), they would then qualify for graduation or promotion to the next academic level.
A student can sit for a re-examination only twice in the same course during their entire tenure at the University, under the specified eligibility conditions.
Re-examinations will be held at a time specified in the University's Academic Calendar.

Administration Timeline for Graduating Students:
For graduating class students, re-examinations shall be administered within four weeks after the official graduation date.

Re-registration for Failed Final Year Essay/Project:
A student who fails their final year essay or project will be allowed to re-register for that essay or project to complete it during the subsequent semester.

Preparation Time and Temporary Registration:
Students shall be given no more than four weeks to prepare for supplemental examinations. The specific date will be determined each year based on available vacation time.
If the examination time extends into the next academic training period, students may be allowed temporary registration. Depending on the re-examination results, this temporary registration may be cancelled or retained once their academic status is determined.

Notification:
The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs is responsible for notifying students eligible for re-examination (re-examinees) and announcing the dates of these re-examinations to both students and academic staff four weeks before the examination date.

---

Topic: University Grading System and Grade Point Calculation

The university employs a letter grade system for academic achievement in its undergraduate programs. A detailed guideline regarding the specific grading system is to be developed by the Senate Standing Committee for Academic Standard and Quality Assurance and endorsed by the Senate.

Standard Letter Grading:
Academic achievement, except for courses with special Senate dispensation, is graded using the following letter grades and corresponding grade points:
A+ : [90-100] = 4.0
A  : [85-90)  = 4.0
A- : [80-85)  = 3.75
B+ : [75-80)  = 3.5
B  : [70-75)  = 3.0
B- : [65-70)  = 2.75
C+ : [60-65)  = 2.5
C  : [50-60)  = 2.0
C- : [45-50)  = 1.75
D  : [40-45)  = 1.0
F  : [0-40)   = 0

Special Grade Notations:
I  = Incomplete (student has not completed all course requirements for reasons beyond their control)
NG = No Grade (recorded when full assessment/examination records are missing)
W  = Withdrawn (student has formally withdrawn from the course/program within the specified timeframe)
DO = Dropout (student has ceased attendance without formal withdrawal or justification)
P  = Pass (for required non-credit work)
** = Course in Progress (rarely used, when no work completed for grading)

Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculation:
Grade point averages (GPAs) are determined by dividing the total grade points earned in a semester by the total number of credit hours attempted in that semester.
A Semester Average Number Grade is determined by dividing total grade points earned in a semester by the number of credit points in that semester.
In a modular system, the final grade of a module is calculated based on the sum of the grades of its independent courses, weighted appropriately.

Handling of 'F' Grade:
A student who scores an 'F' in a course must repeat that course.

Handling of 'NG' (No Grade):
When an instructor records 'NG' due to missing assessment records, it must be changed to one of the following:
'I' (Incomplete): By the School Managing Council (SMC) in consultation with the instructor, for a student who failed to complete the course due to illness or other extraordinary, extenuating circumstances.
'W' (Withdrawn): By the Registrar, for a student who has formally withdrawn from the program within nine weeks (50% of semester duration) after the semester begins.
'DO' (Dropout): By the Registrar, for a student who has not withdrawn according to university procedures and timelines, or has not justified failure to sit for exams.

Impact of 'W' and 'DO' on GPA:
Neither 'W' (Withdrawn) nor 'DO' (Dropout) grades are included in the computation of the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA).

Conversion of 'I' Grades:
The process for converting 'I' grades to other letter grades is detailed elsewhere in Article 111 (likely referring to procedures for make-up exams or completion of pending work).

Justification for 'DO' Grade:
A student who receives a 'DO' for a course must justify to the appropriate SMC why they failed to follow withdrawal procedures, within six weeks after the subsequent semester commences. Failure to do so results in the 'DO' automatically becoming an 'F' grade.

Repeated Courses on Transcript:
If a student repeats a course, both the initial grade and credit hours, and the new grade and credit hours will appear on the transcript. However, the initial attempt's grade and credit hours will be ignored in calculating the SGPA, regardless of whether the grade changed.

Non-Credit Work:
All required non-credit work is recorded as 'P' (Pass) or 'F' (Failure). Neither 'P' nor 'F' for non-credit work is included in SGPA computation.

Topic: General Provisions for Determining Academic Standing

This section sets forth the foundational principles for evaluating a student's academic performance at the end of each semester.

Semester-End Review:
At the conclusion of each semester, every School, following procedures established by its School Managing Council (SMC), will examine the academic record of each student who fails to meet the required academic standards.

Minimum Credit Hours for Status Determination:
The academic status of a student (e.g., good standing, warning, probation, dismissal) will be formally determined when the student has attempted 14 or more credit hours in that semester.

Equivalency for Program Durations:
For the purpose of academic assessment and progression, the university defines equivalencies between different program structures:
One semester in the regular (full-time) program is considered equivalent to two semesters in the Continuing Education Program (e.g., evening or weekend programs).
One academic year in the regular program is considered equivalent to three semesters in the summer in-service program.

Topic: Determining Academic Standing, Warnings, and Dismissals for Students

This article specifies the criteria based on Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) used to determine a student's academic standing, issue academic warnings, or lead to academic dismissal. These rules generally apply to second-year and higher-class students; first-year student rules may differ or be specified elsewhere.

Academic Warning:
A student (second year and above) will be placed on academic warning if, at the end of any semester:
Their SGPA is greater than or equal to 1.50 but less than 1.75, AND/OR
Their CGPA is greater than or equal to 1.75 but less than 2.00.

Good Academic Standing:
A student (second year and above) is considered to be in good academic standing if, at the end of any semester:
Their CGPA is greater than or equal to 2.00, AND
Their SGPA is greater than or equal to 1.75.

Academic Dismissal:
A student (second year and above) shall be dismissed for academic reasons if, at the end of any semester:
Their SGPA is less than 1.50, AND/OR
Their CGPA is less than 1.75.

Specific CGPA Thresholds for Dismissal for Good (Irreversible Dismissal):
A second-year student will face academic dismissal for good if their CGPA is less than 1.75 at the end of any semester.
A third-year and above student will face academic dismissal for good if their CGPA is less than 1.85 at the end of any semester.

Dismissal for Consecutive Poor Performance:
A student who, for two consecutive semesters, either scores an SGPA of less than 1.75 OR fails to maintain a CGPA of 2.00, is subject to dismissal for academic reasons, unless they are officially placed on probation.

Dismissal for Extremely Low SGPA:
A student who fails to achieve an SGPA of 1.00 in any semester is subject to dismissal for good.

Graduation Requirements:
For graduation, a student is required to have:
A minimum overall CGPA of 2.00.
A minimum CGPA of 2.00 in their major area of study.
A student shall not graduate with an 'F' grade in any course.

---

Topic: Procedures for Academic Dismissal and Granting Probation

This section details the process for students who are subject to academic dismissal and the conditions under which they might be granted probation as an alternative.

Dismissal and Probation as a Discretionary Decision:
Students who are subject to dismissal due to academic reasons will be dismissed unless they are specifically placed on probation. Probation is not a right; it is a discretionary decision made by the university to allow students who have fallen below required academic standards to continue their studies.
The purpose of probation is to facilitate the academic rehabilitation of the student. Therefore, the decision to grant probation must be based on an individual consideration of the student's case and a conclusion that, considering all relevant circumstances, there is a reasonable belief that the student can improve their academic performance to the required levels.

Probation Eligibility with Improving SGPA:
A student who, for two consecutive recent semesters, scores an SGPA greater than 2.00, and whose CGPA is greater than or equal to 1.90, may be considered for probation (but not deemed as in "good standing") upon the decision of the respective School Managing Council (SMC).

Inquiry into Academic Failure:
At the end of each semester, each School or department, following procedures set by its SMC, will examine the case of every student subject to dismissal on academic grounds. This inquiry aims to:
Determine the reasons for the student's academic failure.
Assess whether there is a reasonable belief that the student can meet the required academic standards in the future.
A student may be placed on probation if this inquiry determines that valid reasons exist to explain and excuse their low academic average.

Conditions of Probation:
Based on the inquiry into the causes of poor performance, the authorities administering probation for a particular School may attach specific conditions to the granting of probation. The student must meet these conditions to remain enrolled.
These conditions are not punitive but are designed to remove or mitigate the causes of academic failure. They may include:
Restrictions on participation in sports or other extra-curricular activities.
Requirements for special tutoring to overcome academic deficiencies.
Mandatory class attendance.
Other requirements specifically designed to foster the student's academic improvement.

Notification and Enforcement of Probation:
When a student is placed on probation, their Dean or a designated representative must notify the student precisely of their probationary status. This notification will include:
What is expected of them in terms of future academic performance.
Any restrictions or requirements they must adhere to as a condition of probation.
The consequences of failing to meet these conditions.
Copies of this notice will be sent to the student's academic advisor, the Dean of Students Affairs, and the Registrar.
The Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, in collaboration with other relevant university offices, will enforce any probationary restrictions, especially those falling under their purview (e.g., restrictions on extracurricular activities).

Evaluation of Probation and Dismissal Policies:
The Quality Assurance and Relevance Committee of the Senate, along with each School, shall periodically evaluate the experiences gained from implementing these legislative provisions on probation and dismissal. The goal of this evaluation is to determine the common causes of academic failure and to implement appropriate measures to remedy them.

Topic: Provision for Additional School-Specific Academic Requirements

Schools within the university have the authority to establish additional academic requirements for their degree students, beyond the general university-wide standards.
These additional requirements must be approved by the University Senate.
Schools may also provide that students who fail to meet these School-specific additional standards will be subject to dismissal, even if they meet the general university requirements.

Topic: Regulations for Re-admission to the University

This article outlines the conditions and procedures for students seeking re-admission to the university after a period of absence, whether due to academic dismissal or voluntary withdrawal.

Re-admission After Dismissal for Good:
A student who has been dismissed "for good" due to academic deficiencies is generally not eligible to seek readmission into the same program from which they were dismissed.
However, such a dismissed student may apply for admission into a different field of study, typically within the continuing education program. This is subject to the availability of space in the desired program and the payment of all applicable tuition and other fees current at the time of new admission.

General Re-admission Processing:
All re-admissions, regardless of the reason for prior departure, will be processed according to procedures established by the university's Admission and Placement Committee.

Impact of Curricular Changes on Re-admission:
If there have been changes to the curriculum of a program since the student was last enrolled, the student's academic status and course requirements will be determined according to the new curriculum at the time of their application for readmission.

Re-admission of Students in Good Academic Standing (Voluntary Withdrawal):
A student who discontinued their studies for reasons beyond their control, after having stayed for at least one semester in a program and while in good academic standing, may apply for re-admission into the same program.
This can be done multiple times as long as the maximum duration of stay in the program (counted from the date of their very first enrolment) has not expired or will not expire before they can complete the program following re-admission.
If a student is not readmitted immediately due to the University's intake capacity limitations, the expiry date for their maximum duration of stay might not strictly apply in certain contexts (this needs careful interpretation).
Re-admission of students in good standing is always subject to the availability of facilities and necessary budgetary allocations.
If curricular changes have occurred, the program may require the readmitted student to take new courses that have replaced those they had previously taken and passed.
Upon readmission, the program must provide the student with a list of courses from which they will be exempted and a list of any new courses substituting phased-out ones that they will now have to take.
A student who withdrew for medical or legal reasons without completing a minimum of one semester may also be considered for re-admission.
A student who was dismissed due to repeated acts of violation (disciplinary issues) will generally not be considered for readmission unless the original dismissal decision explicitly allows for it.

Re-Admission of Academically Dismissed Students:
A student dismissed for academic reasons may be allowed re-admission if all the following conditions are fulfilled:
The student applies for re-admission at least one semester after their withdrawal/dismissal from the University.
There is available space in the program they wish to re-enter.
There is a reasonable likelihood, as assessed by the university, that the student will be able to raise their grade point to the required level within one semester after re-admission.
The maximum duration of stay in the program has not expired and is not likely to expire before the student can complete the remaining courses of study.
Consequences of Failing After Re-admission: If a dismissed student is re-admitted and allowed to repeat courses, but then fails to attain good academic standing upon the next status determination, they shall be dismissed for good. A student cannot be readmitted to ASTU more than once after an academic dismissal.

Specific CGPA/SGPA Cut-offs for Re-admission After Academic Dismissal:
First Year, End of First Semester Dismissal: A student dismissed with an SGPA of not less than 1.25 may be readmitted. They may be allowed to repeat courses with 'D' or 'F' grades with program consent, without needing SMC approval.
First Year, End of Second Semester Dismissal: A student dismissed with a CGPA of not less than 1.50 may be readmitted. They may repeat 'D' or 'F' grade courses with program consent, without SMC approval.
Second Year Dismissal (Any Semester): A student dismissed with a CGPA of not less than 1.75 may be readmitted. They may repeat 'D' or 'F' grade courses with program consent, without SMC approval.
Third Year and Above Dismissal (Any Semester): A student dismissed with a CGPA of not less than 1.85 may be readmitted. They may repeat 'D' or 'F' grade courses with program consent, without SMC approval.

Application to Other Programs: These readmission regulations for regular undergraduate students also apply to students in Continuing Education Programs, Part-time programs, and Advanced Standing students.

Services for Re-admitted Students: A student re-admitted after dismissal may be entitled to dormitory and cafeteria services for the semester they are repeating. Academically dismissed students who are readmitted may repeat up to five scheduled courses or the equivalent of 15 credit hours during their semester of readmission.

One-Time Re-admission Limit: A student dismissed for academic reasons shall not be readmitted more than once, regardless of any transfer from another university.

Topic: Addressing Graduation Failures

This article outlines the options and procedures for undergraduate students who have completed their coursework but fail to meet the full requirements for graduation, either due to failing grades ('F' or 'D') or an insufficient Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) or Major Grade Point Average (MGPA).

Graduation Failures due to 'F' or 'D' Grades:
An undergraduate student who fails an examination, resulting in an 'F' grade in a course, and this prevents graduation, may be permitted by their School Managing Council (SMC) to register for and repeat the failed course(s). This is contingent upon the course(s) not being phased-out (discontinued).

Graduation Failures due to Inadequate CGPA and/or MGPA:
A student who fails to graduate because their CGPA or MGPA is less than the required minimum of 2.00 may be allowed to improve their standing.
With the permission of the concerned School Managing Council (SMC), such a student may be allowed to register for and repeat a maximum of three courses in which they had previously scored a 'D' grade.
This option is available provided that the inclusion of newly earned (improved) grades in these repeated courses would qualify the student for graduation.
Important Limitation: Repetition of courses under this provision (for 'D' grades to improve CGPA/MGPA for graduation) should not occur more than once for students who have been previously readmitted, and not more than two times for students who have not been previously readmitted.
If applicable, the student will be required to pay all associated fees for the repeated semester(s) or sign an additional cost-sharing agreement.
This provision (130.2 for CGPA/MGPA improvement) does not apply to students who have already been accommodated under Article 110 (Supplementary Examinations/Re-exams).

Certificate of Attendance for Unresolved Graduation Failures:
A student who fails to graduate due to a CGPA or MGPA below the required minimum, or due to an 'F' grade, and who has no further opportunities to upgrade their CGPA/MGPA or remove their 'F' grade (e.g., exhausted repeat options, course unavailability), may be issued a certificate of attendance. Their academic transcript will state that they are a "graduate failure."
